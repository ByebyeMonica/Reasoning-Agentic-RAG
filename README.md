ðŸ”¥ Reasoning Agentic RAG is rapidly emerging as a powerful paradigm that combines the retrieval capabilities of RAG with the decision-making and reasoning abilities of autonomous agents. 
This page curates a comprehensive collection of papers, benchmarks, and frameworks focused on reasoning-centric agentic retrieval. It also includes toolkits for building agentic workflows, 
libraries for training and evaluating reasoning-enhanced RAG systems, and key resources on modular design, reinforcement learning, and real-world deployment. 
Whether you're a researcher, engineer, or enthusiast, this collection aims to guide you through the evolving landscape of intelligent, tool-augmented retrieval.
