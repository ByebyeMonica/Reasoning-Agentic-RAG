ðŸ”¥ Reasoning Agentic RAG enhances retrieval-augmented generation by embedding reasoning capabilities into the retrieval process. This evolving paradigm spans two main classes: predefined reasoning, which follows structured, rule-based workflows, and agentic reasoning, where the model autonomously decides when and how to retrieve or act. This list collects representative papers, frameworks, and tools across both lines of research.
